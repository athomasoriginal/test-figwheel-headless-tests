This repo is meant as a minimal repro test project for running CLJS tests with figwheel.

**repro:**

* build a docker image
  ```command
  docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t test/fig .
  ```
  > `--platform` specified because otherwise chrome doesn't seem to build
  > correctly
* run and exec into docker image
  ```command
  docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash <image-id>
  ```
* run figwheel tests
  ```command
  clojure -M:test-ci
  ```

**Expect:**

We expect the tests to start and run.

**Actual:**

fig builds and then the environment is launched and tests aren't run.
